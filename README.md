![Preview](public/preview.png)

## ✨ Overview

This project is a static landing page developed as part of a technical challenge, focusing on code quality, accessibility, and modern front-end best practices.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- **BEM (Block Element Modifier):**

  - The entire CSS class structure follows the BEM methodology, making the codebase maintainable, scalable, and clear.

- **Accessibility (A11y):**

  - Use of semantic HTML (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`).
  - Labels associated with inputs, keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and descriptive `alt` texts for images.

- **Images and Placeholders:**

  - Even without provided assets, placeholders and public domain images were used to ensure a visual experience close to the reference design.

- **Responsive Layout (Mobile First):**

  - The layout adapts to any device, from mobile to desktop, using Bootstrap 4 and custom media queries.

- **Hamburger Menu:**

  - Responsive navigation with a fully functional hamburger menu on mobile devices.

- **Email Validation with Regex:**
  - The email field in the form uses validation via JavaScript (jQuery + Regex), ensuring only valid emails are accepted.
